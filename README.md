# J I N: A relationship with photography

## A Good Photo Make
 Good photos are aesthetically pleasing, tell a story, or otherwise grab the attention of the viewer such that for some reason, they can't seem to look away. No one ever stopped to look at a photo for longer than five seconds only to think about the camera that took it (unless you're weird like that) but rather for the intrinsic value the photograph provides.



## Digital
The digital camera market today is oversaturated and dare I say possibly bubble worthy. If you were to track and trend the purchasing of new digital cameras over the past [10 years](https://www.statista.com/chart/5782/digital-camera-shipments/) you realize that sales have dropped 87%. At the same time, cameras are being made, marketed, and still sold each year (albeit with smaller demand per year). This to me seems incredibly unsustainable for the near future as more and more consumers will begin to realize that previous year models can offer exactly what they demand at significant discount from the second-hand market. You can see this effect play out in real-time as well. If you were to peel back the covers(earnings report) of the major camera manufacturers you would be hard pressed to even admit that these companies actually make anything selling cameras. 

One may argue that, like computer part, the bleeding edge can push the boundry of what camera manufacurers can actually provide to the general public. But this notion is flawed as the arguably two largest reasons to choose a certain camera is image quality and speed of autofocus. The first option is completely moot as it is impossible to determine from looking at a photograph what camera made it. Which means that a  dinosaur old Epson RD1 can easily take a picture that can be argued to be as aesthecially pleasing (and therefore as good) as one taken with whatever CaNikon 9Dx Mii that comes out in the near future. For speed of autofocus and, by extention, ease of use; I can concede that there does seem to be improvements that can be realized in this space. However, a smartphone can therefore easily take the crown for ease of use and by extension autofocus as they offer the best method of focusing, touch to focus. You cannot compare the next generation of digital camera to the former as you can one genration of CPU or GPU to another as you can objectively demonstrate one's superiority over another using benchmarks and stress-tests. Whereas with cameras, subjectivity reigns and you cannot say that one camera can take a better photo if the person you are trying to convice doesn't like the photo being presented to them or if one can create a photo using a 10 year old Fuji X100 that ends up winning a contest.

So where does that leave the consumer? Well the good news is that they actually benefit the most. Go on your favorite photography supply website and look at all of the brand new models on offer and note how much they cost. Now go to your favorite second hand marketplace and either look for the same model or the most recent previous generation and note how much they now cost. You see how far they can fall? Now realize that this fall is ubiquitous across the line for all major manufacuters. No one is immune. But now guess what? You can buy amazing hardware for barely anything nowadays or you can even say screw camera market my smartphone can do all of this anyway.

This next paragraph is going to involve some hardcore speculation about the current marketing practices of camera manufacturers so put on your tin-foil hats and jump on in with me.

I would like to believe that camera manufacturers want to push the idea that the camera makes the photographer and therefore, the better the camera, the better the photographer. Those like Nikon, Canon, Fuji, Leica also really need normal everyday people to believe this as well. The only people who can purchase the new bleeding edge cameras every generation are only those who are paid by someone else to take photos. That's probably not you or me. However, manufacturers cannot survive by only selling cameras to the professionals. The market is way too small to then justify spending the R&D, marketing, logistics, and assembly of the product to only sell to a fractional market. So they have to put up this facade to the broad spectrum public with disposable income that they too can become incredible photographers if they just buy their new cameras. They need normal everyday people to buy their new cameras if they are to justify any reason to make another one but you can probably already tell that all of a sudden this seems to be unsustainable in the long run. Eventually enough people will start to realize that a Fuji X100f takes pictures no worse than an X100v while costing 33% less. They realize this, buy the X100f and Fuji doesn't see a dime. Maybe I'm not all that crazy for thinking about this in retrospect.

So what should the digital camera industry do? Personally, I believe that new cameras will continue to be pumped out once every couple of years. But sooner or later there will be a time when these companies will have to seriously consider their next steps carefully. The obvious and easiest decision is to wind down the entire industry as a whole. Stop pushing new cameras every 2-3 years and possibly move to a 5+ year cycle. The more difficult thing is to find out how to sustain oneself after the fact. In my mind, video is the next "Big" thing for manufacturers to inject themselves into in order to stay relevant. But that even still seems like living on borrowed time. The best I can think of is for companies to gun for Leica's seat. Of all camera companies, they were the only ones to escape the downward trend relatively unscathed while also posting revenue growth. Either through liscencing out brand names or produce a product that can rival the M series in simplicity, usability, and function. If you can get all of your photography influencers to say on camera that "This is basically a Leica that costs 50% less" you now have your life-ring.








<!-- Welcome to my online portfolio where you can explore both my amateur and professional interests.

For what it's worth I am college educated, graduating with high honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the spring of 2020 in Computer Science.

I have a high affinity towards all things hardware and low lying software with a burgeoning interest in cybersecurity.

There's plenty more that will be included that aren't part related to the above but I'll have to figure out where all of this goes.



### Computer Hardware and System Architechure
I have always enjoyed working with electronics at a basic level: building a custom computer, tearing apart old electronics, reading about new technologies; all of which supported my exposure to an entire new realm of microcontroller devices. It was only when I entered my senior year of college did I begin to fully understand the fundamentals of how all of the electronic devices around the world are built and how similar all of them seem to be. when I learned about Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I started to understand that many if not all of the devices and electronics we encounter on a day to day basis can actually be described simply and prototyped readily.


### Photography
My relationship with photography started as a branch off my relationship with electronics. I remember starting my interest by taking pictures with a old sony point and shoot camera and being amazed at how close I could get to my subjects using the macro mode.
