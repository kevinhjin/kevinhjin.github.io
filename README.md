## KEVIN H. JIN

Welcome to my online portfolio where you can explore both my amateur and professional interests.

For what it's worth I am college educated, graduating with high honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the spring of 2020 in Computer Science.

I have a high affinity towards all things hardware and low lying software with a burgeoning interest in cybersecurity.

There's plenty more that will be included that aren't part related to the above but I'll have to figure out where all of this goes.



### Computer Hardware and System Architechure
I have always enjoyed working with electronics at a basic level: building a custom computer, tearing apart old electronics, reading about new technologies; all of which supported my exposure to an entire new realm of microcontroller devices. It was only when I entered my senior year of college did I begin to fully understand the fundamentals of how all of the electronic devices around the world are built and how similar all of them seem to be. when I learned about Arduino and Raspberry Pi, I started to understand that many if not all of the devices and electronics we encounter on a day to day basis can actually be described simply and prototyped readily.


### Photography
My relationship with photography started as a branch off my relationship with electronics. I remember starting my interest by taking pictures with a old sony point and shoot camera and being amazed at how close I could get to my subjects using the macro mode.
